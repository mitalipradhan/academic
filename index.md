## About Me

Welcome! 

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Fordham University. I am on the job market for the year 2020-21. I study international trade with a focus on exploring pathways to reconcile countriesâ€™ developmental goals with the multilateral trade agenda. My dissertation focuses on the macro impact and distributional consequences of a trade policy reform on developing countries.
