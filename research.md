Impact of Losing Preferential Status: Evidence from the EU's Generalized System of Preferences Reform

**Abstract**

There is a growing chasm between developing and developed countries over the implementation
of multilateral trade rules. While the former still argue for special and differential
treatment (SDT), the latter group wants to rethink the same. The Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP) program, which is at the core of SDT, allows developed countries to grant
non-reciprocal tariff concessions to developing and least developed countries. In 2014, the
European Union (EU) reformed its GSP program, withdrawing preferential tariff concessions
from several developing countries and small territories, taking away a potentially important
driver of economic development for these nations. This paper adds to the limited literature
on withdrawal of unilateral preferences and to the larger debate on SDT. I analyze the impact
of this withdrawal on these countries' exports to the EU using a triple difference specification
with interactive fixed effects that control for preexisting trade patterns, allowing for causal
inference. I find that exports of GSP eligible products of the excluded countries decrease by
1.6% post reform as compared to countries that still receive GSP treatment. This decline is equivalent 
to the average per capita GNI of these excluded countries in the pretreatment period. 
The probability of exporting GSP eligible products decreases by 0.2%. Overall, my findings suggest that 
unilateral tariff concessions are necessary for all developing countries and losing them can
cause exports to the donor countries to decline.
