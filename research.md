**Abstract**

There is a growing disagreement between developing and developed countries over the implementation of multilateral trade rules and at the center of this dispute is special and differential treatment (SDT) claimed by the developing countries. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program falls under SDT and allows developed nations to grant non-reciprocal tariff concessions to developing and least developed countries. In 2014, the European Union (EU) reformed its GSP program, withdrawing preferential tariff concessions from several developing countries and small territories, taking away a potentially important driver of economic development for these nations. In this paper, I analyze the impact of this GSP reform on the excluded countries' exports to the EU. I use a triple difference specification with interactive fixed effects that control for preexisting trade patterns, allowing for causal inference. I find that exports of GSP eligible products of the excluded countries decrease by 1.6\% post reform as compared to countries that still receive GSP treatment. This decline is equivalent to the average per capita gross national income of these excluded countries. The probability of exporting GSP eligible products decreases by 0.2\%. There is no evidence of product diversification or trade diversion to other countries to compensate for these losses. Overall, my findings suggest that unilateral tariff concessions are necessary for all developing countries and losing them can cause exports to the donor countries to decline. This paper adds to the limited literature on withdrawal of unilateral preferences and to the larger debate on the importance of SDT.
