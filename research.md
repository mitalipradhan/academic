**Impact of Losing Preferential Status: Evidence from the EU's Generalized System of Preferences Reform**
(Job Market Paper)
[[PDF]](/assets/jmp/Pradhan_Mitali_Paper.pdf).

**Abstract:**
There is a growing disagreement between developing and developed countries over the implementation of multilateral trade rules and at the center of this dispute is special and differential treatment (SDT) claimed by the developing countries. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program falls under SDT and allows developed nations to grant non-reciprocal tariff concessions to developing and least developed countries. In 2014, the European Union (EU) reformed its GSP program, withdrawing preferential tariff concessions from several developing countries and small territories. In this paper, I analyze the impact of this GSP reform on the excluded countries' exports to the EU. I use a triple difference specification with interactive fixed effects that control for preexisting trade patterns, allowing for causal inference. I find that exports of GSP eligible products from the excluded countries decrease by 1.6 percent post reform as compared to countries that still receive GSP treatment. This decline is equivalent to the average per capita gross national income of these excluded countries. The probability of exporting a GSP eligible product decreases by 0.2 percentage points. There is no evidence of product diversification or trade diversion to other countries to compensate for these losses. Overall, my findings suggest that unilateral tariff concessions are necessary for all developing countries and losing them can cause exports to the donor countries to decline. In arguing for the importance of GSP, this paper also adds crucial evidence on the relevance of SDT.

**Role of State Capacity in Export Facilitation: Evidence from South Asia**

**Abstract:**
In this paper, I use firm level data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey database, to investigate the state of hard and soft infrastructure within firms in South Asia. Some of these firms are located within an export processing zone or an industrial park facilitated by the government. This in theory should help them overcome bureaucratic bottlenecks and ease capacity constraints. By comparing firms located within such industrial enclaves with those located outside, I investigate whether the ground reality confirms theory and, in that case, whether firms in the latter category indeed fare better in terms of exports prospects. I am now in the process of estimating the impact of such state facilitated infrastructure on exports, and I intend to complete the paper shortly.

**Relevant Work Experience**

**Short Term Consultant, World Bank**

As a part of the joint work with the World Bank, we are analyzing a novel dataset that represents the universe of operators of industrial zones located along India’s Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC). The EEC spans across six Indian states and is in close proximity to Nepal and Bhutan and further extends into Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is thus a vital link that facilitates trade, investment and economic integration in the South Asian region. The objective of this project is to highlight the current state of hard and soft infrastructure available in industrial zones in the EEC, identify gaps that restrict these zones’ production and trading capabilities and consequently, make policy recommendations to the government in terms of specific actionable steps that can help address these gaps so that these industrial hubs can attract foreign direct investment, contribute to trade and employment in the region.
