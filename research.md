**Impact of Losing Preferential Status: Evidence from the EU's Generalized System of Preferences Reform**
(Job Market Paper)
[[PDF]](/assets/jmp/Pradhan_Mitali_Paper.pdf).

**Abstract:**
There is a growing disagreement between developing and developed countries over the implementation of multilateral trade rules and at the center of this dispute is special and differential treatment (SDT) claimed by the developing countries. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program falls under SDT and allows developed nations to grant non-reciprocal tariff concessions to developing and least developed countries. In 2014, the European Union (EU) reformed its GSP program, withdrawing preferential tariff concessions from several developing countries and small territories. In this paper, I analyze the impact of this GSP reform on the excluded countries' exports to the EU. I use a triple difference specification with interactive fixed effects that control for preexisting trade patterns, allowing for causal inference. I find that exports of GSP eligible products from the excluded countries decrease by 1.6 percent post reform as compared to countries that still receive GSP treatment. This decline is equivalent to the average per capita gross national income of these excluded countries. The probability of exporting a GSP eligible product decreases by 0.2 percentage points. There is no evidence of product diversification or trade diversion to other countries to compensate for these losses. Overall, my findings suggest that unilateral tariff concessions are necessary for all developing countries and losing them can cause exports to the donor countries to decline. In arguing for the importance of GSP, this paper also adds crucial evidence on the relevance of SDT.

**Impact of Losing Preferential Status: Evidence from Bangladesh**

**Abstract:**
Exports contribute almost 15% of Bangladesh’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the United States (U.S.) is the largest geographical market for the country’s products. Bangladesh was suspended from the U.S. GSP in 2013 on grounds of workers’ rights violations. In this paper, I estimate the impact of losing non-reciprocal tariff concessions for Bangladesh using a synthetic control function approach. I construct a counterfactual unit for Bangladesh using data on imports to the U.S. and a set of macro variables from the World Development Indicators database for the other seven SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) countries, namely Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. I am now estimating the impacts of the suspension on Bangladesh’s exports and intend to complete the paper shortly.

**Relevant Work Experience**
**Short Term Consultant, World Bank**

As a part of the joint work with the World Bank, we are analyzing a novel dataset that represents the universe of operators of industrial zones located along India’s Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC). The EEC spans across six Indian states and is in close proximity to Nepal and Bhutan and further extends into Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is thus a vital link that facilitates trade, investment and economic integration in the South Asian region. The objective of this project is to highlight the current state of hard and soft infrastructure available in industrial zones in the EEC, identify gaps that restrict these zones’ production and trading capabilities and consequently, make policy recommendations to the government in terms of specific actionable steps that can help address these gaps so that these industrial hubs can attract foreign direct investment, contribute to trade and employment in the region.
